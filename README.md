  ## Usage

  Once the user hits the landing page, she/he sees the option to go to a dashboard page, log in page, or view the current blogs on the Tech Blog. When the user clicks on a blog, they're able to view the individual blog and leave a comment. If the user has not signed up or logged in, she/he can do so by entering their name, email, and a password. Once they log in, the user can start creating, updating, and deleting blogs. Once the user is satisfied with their blog portfolio they can terminate the session and leave the page. The user is then able to return at any time to start a fresh new blog.
